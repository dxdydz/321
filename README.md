# 3 2 1
3 2 1 is a collection of three new games for one, two, and three players, respectively.

1. Zoning Out is a devious game of urban planning under constraints for one or more players.
2. A River in Egypt is a cut-throat battle of luck and logic for two or three players.
3. Love Triangle is a lightweight dice-rolling affair of chained incentives for three players.
