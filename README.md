# 3 2 1
3 2 1 is a collection of three new games for the [Pyramid Arcade](https://www.looneylabs.com/games/pyramid-arcade) for 1, 2, and 3 players, respectively.

1. [Zoning Out](zoningout.md) is a devious game of urban planning under constraints for one or more players.
2. [A River in Egypt](riverinegypt.md) is a cut-throat battle of luck and logic for two or three players.
3. [Love Triangle](lovetriangle.md) is a lightweight dice-rolling affair of chained incentives for three players.

All games designed by Spencer Cappallo, though **Zoning Out** and **A River in Egypt** owe a great debt to **Sprawlopolis** and **Schotten-Totten**, respectively.
