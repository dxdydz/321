# A River in Egypt
2 players
15-30 minutes

## Equipment
- 3 trios in five colors
- Bag for random drawing (N.B., three bags are even nicer, if you have them. Bowls work well if players can be trusted not to peek.)
- (Optional, but nice to have) 9 playing cards or coasters or beer mats or similar

## Setup
- Place all the pyramids in the bag. If using three bags, separate the pyramids by size, one size for each bag.
- Draw 3 large, 3 medium, and 3 small pieces from the bag. Place these in a line between the two players. If using playing cards, lay the playing cards face down in a line first and place the pieces on top of them, one piece per card.
- Each player draws a large, a medium, and a small. 
- Choose a player to go first.

## Gameplay
- Players take turns
- On your turn, you must, if possible, play a piece from your hand to your side of an unclaimed segment of river. You may never have more than 2 pieces on your side of a river segment. If you are unable to play a piece (due to all segments being either claimed, or filled with two segments on your side), you do not play a piece and you will not draw a replacement, but you will till be able to claim segments.
- After playing your piece, you may claim any river segments for which you can prove you have a stronger or equal set of three pieces (your two + the shared river piece). In the simplest case, both you and your opponent have played 2 pieces each to your respective sides of the river, and you have the stronger set. It may be the case, however, that due to pieces that have been played or drawn into players’ hands, it can be logically proven that your opponent is incapable of producing a superior set of three pieces. In this case, you may claim the segment even if your opponent has not finished filling their side of the segment. 
- You must have played both your pieces to a segment to claim it, even if you already have a superior set after playing only a single piece.
- You may only claim one segment per turn.
- Note: You must prove that your opponent can not produce a superior set of pieces. In the case where two players could play identical pieces to either side of a segment, the claim goes to the player who can make the claim first.
- If you claim a river segment, take the shared river piece and place it behind your 2nd piece, as though you are playing it as a third piece. This lets both players know that that segment is no longer in play.
- After placing a piece and optionally claiming a segment, you draw one piece to replace the one you’ve played. You must draw a piece of the same size as the one you played, so that you usually have one large, one medium, and one small in your hand. If a size is exhausted through the course of play, you do not draw a different size. Instead, you continue play with a diminished hand size.

## Game End
The game ends immediately when one player has either:
- A. claimed three adjacent river segments, or
- B. claimed 5 out of the 9 available river segments.
That player is the winner.

Comparing Sets of Pieces
- Sets of three pieces are evaluated based on their strength to establish river segment claims. The set type takes precedence, followed by size, and finally: color. The set types are as follows, in order from best to worst:
  - Monochrome triplet: Three identical pieces of the same size and color
  - Monochrome run: Three pieces in the same color, all different sizes
  - Monochrome pair: Two pieces of the same size and color, with a third piece of any size or color.
  - Triplet: Three pieces of the same size, but different colors
  - Run: Three pieces of all different sizes and all different colors
  - Pair: Two pieces of the same size, and different colors
In the event that the two players both have the same type of set, it is resolved based first on size, then color. So, a monochrome triplet of size 3 always beats a monochrome triplet of size 2. If the type and size are equivalent, color is used in the order (from best to worst):
Black
Red
Yellow
Green
Blue
In the case of a non-monochrome set, color does not matter, and it is only a matter of which player can stake their claim first.


Variants
The player with the weaker “hand” goes first. That is, if you were to evaluate the small, medium, and large pieces that each player draws at the start of the game as though they were three pieces in the game, whoever has a weaker hand is the starting player. For example, if Anna draws a K3, K2, K1 and Betty draws a B3, Y2, B1, Betty would go first.

Three Player Variant: Confluence
Instead of fighting for 9 segments, each player fights for 6 segments, 3 against each other player. Lay out three river segments between each pair of players (DIAGRAM HERE). Play proceeds identically to the 2 player game, except the win conditions are different. Continue play until all river segments have been claimed.

If one player has won more segments than both their opponents, they are the winner, eg, Anna won 2 segments against Betty and also 2 segments against Constance.
In the event of a three-way tie, players form sets from the three river segments the each won. Whichever player has the strongest set of river pieces is the winner. In the unlikely event that there is still a tie, victory is shared.


Other colors
The rules are written for the “rainbow treehouse” colors, as they are the ones most players are likely to have, but there is nothing intrinsic to these colors. You can play with any five colors, provided you and the other player can agree upon which colors beat which colors prior to play. For Xeno colors, consider the order Orange, Cyan, Purple, White, Clear.
